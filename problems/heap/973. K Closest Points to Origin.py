# Problem
# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

# The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

# You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

# Solution
# Time O(NlogK): heapify takes only O(logK) time as we keep our heap at most size K; and space O(N).
# To keep K closet (or K elements with smallest distance) we should use max heap. (smallest -> max heap, largest -> min heap)!!! And we keep the size of the heap at maximum K elements. Thus the resulting heap itself is K closest points to (0,0).

        if len(max_heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    return [heapq.heappop(max_heap)[1] for _ in range(k)]
